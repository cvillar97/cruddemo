# Course of Luv2Code
## :rocket: Introduction
This repository contains the projects that I made about the course given by "Chad Darby" in order to apply the learned concepts. I learned core concepts of the Spring framework and its main parts: Spring boot, Spring Data Jpa, Spring Data REST and Spring Security. I took the course this year (2024) and I can recommend to take it after learning the main Java core concepts.

Personally I used different branches for focusing on how i implemented a certain technology on each, and that way be able to compare its previous status in other branch. 

## What i did in this course
-	Mastered the fundamentals of Spring framework, including Hibernate & JPA for object-relational mapping.
-	Learned to configure Maven for project management and build automation.
-	Developed RESTful APIs and endpoints for web services.
-	Understood multi-layered architecture for application design.
-	Implemented Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection principles for better code maintainability.
-	Utilized Spring Data JPA and Spring Data REST for simplified database interactions.
-	Applied Spring Security for securing applications, including endpoint authorization based on roles with Bcrypt encryption.
